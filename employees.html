    <h3 align="left">Catherine Mills <aside><img src="pp1.jpg" alt="Pet's love" width="180" height="150" align="left"></aside></h3> <p>Hi! My name is Catherine Mills. I am 34 years old. I just moved up here to Paoli with my husband and daughter. She is in the fun 2 year old age. We have been up here for almost 2 years. I was born and raised in Chapel Hill, NC - home of the UNC TarHeels! I graduated from UNC with a degree in sport administration. I have worked as a nanny for the past 15 years. I love hanging with the kids as well as their pets. I know what it means to be dependable and reliable, and how important communication is. I am a very neat and organized person, and love to have fun! I love getting outside as much as possible. I look forward to helping out, and taking care of your pets. </p>

         <h3 align="left">Bill Gates<aside> <img src="pp2.jpg" alt="Pet's love" width="180" height="180" align="left"></aside></h3><p>Bill lives in Bryn Mawr, PA with his wife, two boys, his Norwegian Buhund rescue dog, two American Short Hair cats, and two Shubunkin goldfish. An avid dog lover, Bill enlisted in the Air Force to become a dog trainer, where he spent over 9 years training dogs in attack work, narcotics and explosives detection and even trip-wire detection. However, besides dogs, he has always loved working with all types of animals: dogs, cats, horses, fish, hamsters, rabbits, guinea pigs, and any other creepy crawly critters. In addition to having served for over 9 years in the Air Force, he served another 20 years as an officer in the Marine Corps, before leaving to attend medical school. He has a Bachelor's degree in mathematics, a Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering and is currently a 3rd year medical student studying to become a physician. When Bill isn't studying he loves spending time with animals; if he weren't learning the intricacies of the human body, he most likely would have gone to veterinary medical school instead. Contact Bill, he is looking forward to meeting with you to discuss your pet's needs!</p>
